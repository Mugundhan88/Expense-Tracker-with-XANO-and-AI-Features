# Expense Tracker Project Todo List

## Phase 1: Research and Design*   [x] **Task 1: Research XANO Capabilities (Step 002)**
    *   [x] Investigate XANO free tier limitations (database, API calls, features).
        *   Workspaces: 1
        *   Team Size: 1
        *   Records of Data: 100,000
        *   Database SSD Storage: 1GB
        *   Image/File Storage: 1GB (Images only - watermarked)
        *   Performance Rate Limiting: 10 requests/20sec (This is a critical constraint for API design and AI feature interaction)
        *   Schema Versioning: Up to 3 versions
        *   Background tasks: 5
        *   Geographical Region: U.S. Only
        *   File Bandwidth: 1GB
        *   File Upload Limit: 64MB (Important for receipt image uploads)
    *   [x] Understand database table creation and schema design in XANO (Conceptual understanding based on documentation; practical application pending access).
    *   [x] Learn how to create and manage REST API endpoints in XANO (Conceptual understanding based on documentation; practical application pending access).
    *   [x] Research XANO's file upload capabilities for receipts (Confirmed: 64MB limit, images watermarked on free tier).
    *   [x] Explore options for integrating external AI services (OCR, NLP) with XANO or running custom functions (XANO can call external APIs; rate limits are a concern. Custom functions might be possible via XANO's function stack, but external processing for heavy AI tasks is likely better).
    *   [x] Check XANO's support for generating Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (XANO automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for APIs).
    *   [x] Document findings relevant to the expense tracker project (Completed in this task).
*   [x] **Task 2: Design System Architecture (Step 003)**
    *   [x] Define database schema (users, expenses, categories, receipts) - Documented in system_architecture.md
    *   [x] Design API endpoints (user auth, expense CRUD, receipt upload, analysis, predictions) - Documented in system_architecture.md
    *   [x] Plan AI feature integration points - Documented in system_architecture.md
*   [x] **Task 3: Clarify XANO Access (Ongoing)**
    *   [x] Await user response on providing XANO account access or proceeding with simulated implementation - Proceeded with simulation as per user instruction.

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation (XANO)

*   [x] **Task 4: Implement XANO Backend (Step 004)**
    *   [x] Set up database tables in XANO (if access provided) - Simulated in xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
    *   [x] Create API endpoints in XANO (if access provided) - Simulated in xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
    *   [x] Implement user authentication (if access provided) - Simulated in xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
    *   [x] Implement expense CRUD operations (if access provided) - Simulated in xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
    *   [x] Implement receipt upload functionality (if access provided) - Simulated in xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
    *   [x] If XANO access is not provided, document the detailed steps and configurations that *would* be done in XANO - Completed: /home/ubuntu/xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.

## Phase 3: AI Feature Development

*   [x] **Task 5: Develop Receipt OCR and NLP (Step 005)**
    *   [x] Choose/research OCR tools/libraries (e.g., Tesseract.js, Google Vision API - considering free tier options) - Tesseract OCR selected and installed.
    *   [x] Develop Python script for OCR to extract text from receipt images - Completed: /home/ubuntu/receipt_parser.py
    *   [x] Develop Python script for NLP to extract vendor, date, total from OCR text - Completed: /home/ubuntu/receipt_parser.py (includes basic regex-based NLP).
    *   [x] Plan how this script will be triggered (e.g., by XANO webhook if possible, or as a separate service) - Documented in system_architecture.md and xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md; to be run as an external service called by XANO.
*   [x] **Task 6: Develop Spending Pattern Analysis (Step 005)**
    *   [x] Develop Python script to analyze expense data (from XANO or simulated data) - Completed: /home/ubuntu/spending_analyzer.py
    *   [x] Implement analysis by category and time - Completed in /home/ubuntu/spending_analyzer.py.
    *   [x] Define output format for analysis (JSON) - Implemented in /home/ubuntu/spending_analyzer.py.
*   [x] **Task 7: Develop Predictive Budgeting (Step 006)**
    *   [x] Develop Python script for simple predictive budgeting based on past averages - Completed: /home/ubuntu/predictive_budgeter.py
    *   [x] Define prediction output (e.g., forecasted monthly spend per category) - Implemented in /home/ubuntu/predictive_budgeter.py.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

*   [x] **Task 8: Integrate AI Features with Backend (Steps 005, 006)**
    *   [x] Define how AI scripts will communicate with XANO (API calls) - Documented in system_architecture.md and xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md.
*   [x] **Task 9: Validate Backend and AI Features (Step 008)**
    *   [x] Test API endpoints thoroughly (using tools like Postman or Swagger UI) - Simulated testing approach documented in user_guide.md and testing_credentials_swagger_url.md.
    *   [x] Test OCR with sample receipts - Completed with /home/ubuntu/test_data/sample_receipt.png, output in /home/ubuntu/test_data/receipt_output.json.
    *   [x] Test spending analysis with sample data - Completed with /home/ubuntu/test_data/sample_expenses.json, output in /home/ubuntu/test_data/analysis_output.json.
    *   [x] Test predictive budgeting with sample data - Completed with /home/ubuntu/test_data/sample_expenses.json, output in /home/ubuntu/test_data/prediction_output.json.

## Phase 5: Documentation and Submission

*   [x] **Task 10: Prepare User Guide and Video Script (Step 007)**
    *   [x] Write a detailed user guide for the expense tracker - Completed: /home/ubuntu/user_guide.md

*   [x] **Task 11: Prepare Submission Materials (Step 009)**
    *   [x] Prepare user credentials for testing the application - Documented in /home/ubuntu/testing_credentials_swagger_url.md.
    *   [x] Obtain/generate the Swagger URL for the XANO backend (if access provided, otherwise explain how it would be obtained) - Documented in /home/ubuntu/testing_credentials_swagger_url.md.
*   [x] **Task 12: Report and Submit (Step 010)**
    *   [x] Compile all deliverables - Completed.
