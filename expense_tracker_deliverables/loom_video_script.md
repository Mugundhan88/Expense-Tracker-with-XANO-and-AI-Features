# Expense Tracker - Loom Video Script

**Video Title:** Expense Tracker with XANO Backend & AI Features - Implementation Walkthrough

**Objective:** To explain the implementation of the expense tracker, focusing on the XANO backend (simulated), AI features (receipt OCR, spending analysis, predictive budgeting), and how they integrate.

**(0:00-0:15) Introduction**

*   **Visual:** Title card with project name, your name/team name.
*   **Voiceover:** "Hello! This video demonstrates an expense tracker application built with a XANO backend and several AI-powered features. We'll walk through the concept, architecture, backend setup (simulated for this project), the AI scripts, and how they all tie together. The primary goal was to showcase an approach to building such a system, focusing on problem-solving and familiarity with XANO concepts."

**(0:15-0:45) Project Overview & Requirements**

*   **Visual:** Briefly show the initial project requirements/prompt.
*   **Voiceover:** "The core task was to create an expense tracker that can categorize and analyze spending patterns. Key implementation requirements included using XANO for the backend, and incorporating AI features like receipt image recognition, spending pattern analysis, and predictive budgeting."

**(0:45-1:30) System Architecture**

*   **Visual:** Show a simplified diagram of the architecture (XANO backend, external AI services/scripts, data flow). Refer to `system_architecture.md`.
*   **Voiceover:** "Here’s a high-level look at the system architecture. We have a central XANO backend, which is responsible for storing all user data, expenses, categories, and receipt information. It also exposes APIs for these operations. For the AI features, we've developed Python scripts that would ideally be deployed as external microservices. XANO would interact with these services via API calls to perform tasks like OCR or to get analysis results."
*   **Voiceover:** "We’ve designed this with XANO’s free tier limitations in mind, such as API rate limits and storage caps, which are detailed in our documentation."

**(1:30-3:00) XANO Backend Setup (Simulated Walkthrough)**

*   **Visual:** Screen recording (if you have XANO access and set it up) or static images/diagrams from `xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md` showing:
    *   XANO dashboard (conceptual).
    *   Database table structures (`users`, `categories`, `expenses`, `receipts`). Briefly highlight key fields.
    *   API endpoint list in XANO (e.g., `/auth/register`, `/expenses`, `/receipts/upload`).
    *   A conceptual look at a XANO function stack for one or two key APIs (e.g., user registration or expense creation).
*   **Voiceover:** "Since AI cannot directly create online accounts, we’ve simulated the XANO backend setup. The `xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md` file provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how one would configure this in XANO. This includes setting up the database tables – users, categories, expenses, and receipts – with specific fields and relationships as defined in our architecture."
*   **Voiceover:** "Similarly, we’ve defined all the necessary API endpoints. For example, endpoints for user authentication, CRUD operations for expenses, uploading receipt images, and fetching analytical reports. XANO’s function stack would be used to build the logic for each of these, handling database interactions, input validation, and calls to external AI services."
*   **Voiceover:** "XANO also automatically generates a Swagger or OpenAPI specification for the defined APIs, which is crucial for testing and integration. This URL would be one of the key deliverables if the backend were live."

**(3:00-5:00) AI Feature 1: Receipt Image Recognition (OCR + NLP)**

*   **Visual:**
    *   Show the `receipt_parser.py` script in a code editor.
    *   Show a sample receipt image.
    *   Terminal/console output of running the script with the sample image.
    *   The JSON output from the script.
*   **Voiceover:** "Now let’s look at the AI features. First, receipt image recognition. We're using Tesseract OCR via a Python script called `receipt_parser.py`. This script takes an image path, extracts the raw text, and then applies some basic Natural Language Processing using regular expressions to identify the vendor, transaction date, and total amount."
*   **Voiceover:** "Here’s an example. (Show running the script). As you can see, it processes the image and outputs the extracted text and then the parsed JSON data. This JSON data would then be sent back to XANO to update the corresponding receipt record."
*   **Voiceover:** "In a real-world scenario, this script would be wrapped in a web service. When a receipt is uploaded to XANO, XANO would call this service, which then processes the image and updates XANO with the results."

**(5:00-6:30) AI Feature 2: Spending Pattern Analysis**

*   **Visual:**
    *   Show the `spending_analyzer.py` script.
    *   Show a sample `expenses.json` input file.
    *   Terminal/console output of running the script.
    *   The JSON output showing spending summaries.
*   **Voiceover:** "Next, spending pattern analysis. The `spending_analyzer.py` script takes a JSON file of expense records – data that would typically come from our XANO database. It then analyzes this data to provide insights like total spending, spending broken down by category with percentages, and spending trends over time, for example, monthly totals."
*   **Voiceover:** "Here’s a quick run with some sample expense data. (Show running the script). The output is a structured JSON containing the summary, category breakdown, and time-based analysis. This data would be fetched via a XANO API endpoint, with XANO either performing these calculations internally or by calling this analysis script as an external service."

**(6:30-7:30) AI Feature 3: Predictive Budgeting**

*   **Visual:**
    *   Show the `predictive_budgeter.py` script.
    *   Use the same sample `expenses.json`.
    *   Terminal/console output of running the script, perhaps for a specific category.
    *   The JSON output showing future predictions.
*   **Voiceover:** "The third AI feature is predictive budgeting. The `predictive_budgeter.py` script uses historical expense data to forecast future spending. For this demonstration, it uses a simple method of averaging past spending for a given category to predict for future periods, like the next few months."
*   **Voiceover:** "Running this script (show example) with our sample data and specifying a category, we get a JSON output that includes the average historical spend and predictions for upcoming periods. Again, this functionality would be exposed via a XANO API endpoint."

**(7:30-8:15) Integration and Workflow**

*   **Visual:** Revisit the architecture diagram, highlighting the data flow for one or two key user actions (e.g., uploading a receipt and seeing it processed, or requesting a spending report).
*   **Voiceover:** "So, how does this all fit together? A user uploads a receipt image. XANO stores it and triggers our external OCR service. The service processes it using `receipt_parser.py` and sends the extracted data back to XANO. Later, when the user wants to see their spending patterns, XANO queries its database and might call the `spending_analyzer.py` service to generate the report. The key is that XANO acts as the orchestrator and data hub."

**(8:15-8:45) Testing and Validation**

*   **Visual:** Briefly mention the testing approach.
    *   Show the `user_guide.md` section on testing.
    *   Mention using Postman/Swagger for API testing (conceptual).
    *   Show running the Python scripts with sample data (as already done).
*   **Voiceover:** "For testing, the XANO backend APIs would be tested using tools like Postman or XANO’s built-in Swagger UI. The Python AI scripts have been tested individually with sample data, and their command-line usage is documented in the user guide. The `user_guide.md` provides sample data and commands for testing each component."

**(8:45-9:15) Submission Deliverables**

*   **Visual:** List the key deliverables (code files, documentation files like `system_architecture.md`, `xano_implementation_guide_simulated.md`, `user_guide.md`, this video script, etc.).
*   **Voiceover:** "The complete submission includes all the Python scripts, detailed documentation covering the system architecture, the simulated XANO setup guide, a user guide, this video script, and the `todo.md` checklist. If this were a live XANO deployment, we would also provide the Swagger URL and test user credentials."

**(9:15-9:30) Conclusion & Challenges**

*   **Visual:** Thank you slide.
*   **Voiceover:** "This project demonstrates a feasible approach to building an intelligent expense tracker using XANO and Python-based AI modules. Key challenges in a real-world free-tier scenario would be XANO’s API rate limits and the need to efficiently manage external service calls. Thank you for watching!"

**General Notes for Recording:**

*   Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.
*   Ensure visuals are clear and correspond to what you're explaining.
*   Keep transitions smooth.
*   If you have a XANO account, showing even a basic setup of a table or API endpoint would be more engaging than static images for that section. If not, the simulated approach described is fine.
